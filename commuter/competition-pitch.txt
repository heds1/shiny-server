The Aotearoa Commuter Visualiser shows the journeys from home to work
that Kiwis took on Census day 2018. The journeys are represented by direct
lines, and the different commute types can be toggled on or off, allowing an
easy comparison of the different ways we get to work. A layer showing the
regional council boundaries can also be toggled, and clicking on a region
brings up a summary of the region's distribution of commute types.

Two Stats NZ datasets were used in the creation of this map. The commuter data was
extracted from the "2018 Census Main means of travel to education by Statistical
Area 2" dataset, while the regional council layer was extracted from the
"Statistical Area 2 Higher Geographies 2018 (generalised)" dataset. The data
were grouped by unique residence/workplace combinations so that the displayed
lines could take on different weights depending on the number of people taking
that particular journey.

The product is an R Shiny application that uses the Leaflet library to render an
interactive map. The code used to process the data and run the app is free and
open source, and the app is deployed onto cloud servers that can be scaled up
and down quickly and efficiently to allow for greater or lesser web traffic.

The map can easily be updated with new features, and community contributions and
feature requests are welcomed.
